    <p>
      If you want good croissants, you need good butter. They've got that in
      France. "It's no secret that dairy in France and most of Europe is higher
      quality than most of the U.S.," Chan said, and while there are a number of
      artisanal North American farms stepping up their game, European-style
      butter, which tends to contain more butterfat, remains the best. So much
      so, Chan said, that he's worked at French restaurants stateside that
      imported butter from France, but for most, it's not really cost-efficient.
